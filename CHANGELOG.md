## [3.0.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- **Build Screen**: A dedicated builds page lists the pipeline runs of every microfrontend of the project and streams their status live over server-sent events, with the run history and a status badge per microfrontend. The status is read through the provider each microfrontend is hosted on — GitHub Actions, GitLab pipelines and Azure DevOps builds — and exposed by `GET /api/builds`
- **User Profile Page**: A profile page where the logged in user edits their personal data and uploads, replaces or removes their avatar. The avatar is stored server-side and is what the sidebar user button renders
- **Canary Strategies**: The canary is no longer a single on/off split. A microfrontend picks between a random percentage, a sticky per-session assignment, and an explicit list of enrolled users, and the release settings moved into their own section of the microfrontend form. Existing microfrontends are migrated on boot
- **Bulk Canary User Actions**: Canary users can be enabled, disabled or removed in bulk from the selection in the canary users table
- **Global Variables Script**: The generated integration writes a global variables script straight into the host document, addressed per project, so a host picks up the environment variables of the project without wiring them by hand. The integration dialog generates and previews it
- **Marketing Opt-In At Registration**: The registration form collects a marketing consent, stored on the user and gated by configuration, so it only shows where the deployment enables it
- **Last Login Tracking**: The user record keeps the date of the last login, updated when a token is issued
- **Per-Page Document Head**: Every page sets its own document title through a `PageHead` component, the authentication and single-page layouts included
- **Logged In User In The Bootstrap**: The generated bootstrap names the logged in user, so a host can read it without an extra call
- **Sidebar Logo**: The sidebar header shows the MFE Orchestrator logo

### Changed

- **Generated Configuration Carries Its Origin**: `backendUrl` and `projectId` are written into the generated configuration, so a served microfrontend knows which backend and project it belongs to without being told
- **Microfrontends Table**: The host is rendered as an icon instead of a text column and the canary cell has room for the strategy it now describes
- **Microfrontend Graph Nodes**: The nodes of the microfrontend flow were redrawn into their own component
- **Error Handling**: The unregistered error handler was dropped and the not-found errors became typed per entity (`EnvironmentNotFoundError`, `ProjectNotFoundError`), so the plugin answers with the right status
- **Lint**: Unused-import removal is enforced across the whole repo, hooks included

### Fixed

- **Serving On The Resolved Environment**: Microfrontend files are served on the environment actually resolved from the request instead of a stale one
- **Federated Access Decision**: A federated access is decided from the token instead of from a request header
- **Scoped Package Registry URL**: The whole npm package name is encoded in the registry URL, so scoped packages resolve
- **Mail Fixture Decoding**: The ampersand entity is decoded last in the end-to-end mail fixture

### CI

- The monorepo build no longer runs on pull requests
- The actions pinned by the workflows were upgraded

---

## [2.3.0] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- **Bulk Repository Import**: From the microfrontends dashboard, an "Import from repository" action lists every repository reachable through a code repository connection (GitHub account/organization, GitLab group, Azure DevOps project) and creates a microfrontend for each selected one. Repositories already linked to a microfrontend are flagged and skipped, slug collisions get a numeric suffix, and each import is reported individually so one failing repository does not abort the batch. Backed by `GET /api/repositories/:codeRepositoryId/importable-repositories` and `POST /api/repositories/:codeRepositoryId/import`, documented in [docs/REPOSITORY-IMPORT.md](docs/REPOSITORY-IMPORT.md)
- **Module Federation Integration**: One button wires module federation into every microfrontend of a project, and the console generates the integration instructions for the stack each microfrontend actually uses instead of a single generic snippet
- **Stack Detection**: Every microfrontend remembers the stack it was detected on, which is what lets the generated configuration match its build tool
- **Cross-Repository Dependency Analysis**: Scans the repositories of a project through the provider API, compares the declared ranges against the npm registry and rewrites the misaligned `peerDependencies` on a dedicated branch. Each microfrontend can be compared on a branch of its own. Documented in [docs/DEPENDENCIES.md](docs/DEPENDENCIES.md)
- **Server-Side Canary Resolution**: The canary version is resolved on the backend and pinned in the URL, the per-user enrolment is reachable, and the deployment cards show the split each microfrontend is serving
- **Environment-Free Serving**: The manifest, the global variables and the microfrontend configuration are served without an environment in the URL, so one build reaches every environment
- **Dedicated Serve CORS Allow-List**: `ALLOWED_SERVE_ORIGINS` applies its own list to the `/serve/*` endpoints, falling back to `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
- **Configurable Rate Limit**: The per-IP request ceiling is configurable instead of hardcoded
- **Design System Adoption**: The frontend renders through `@mfe-orchestrator/design-system`, sidebar included, in place of the local UI components
- **Secret Visibility Toggle**: Secret values can be revealed and hidden again in the forms that hold them
- **Clone With IntelliJ**: The clone popover of a microfrontend offers the JetBrains protocol next to HTTPS and SSH
- **End-To-End Coverage**: Playwright suites for login, project creation, project invitations, and CRUD of environments, API keys and storage providers

### Changed

- **Repository Listing Pagination**: `GithubClient.getRepositories` and `GitlabClient.getRepositoriesByGroupId` now walk every page instead of returning only the provider's first page (30 repositories on GitHub, 20 on GitLab), so repository pickers and the bulk import see the complete list
- **Host Injection Dropped**: The old host injection is replaced by the federation integration
- **Client SDK Scope**: The generated configurations and the published package both point at the `mfe-orchestrator-hub` scope
- **Pinned Deployable Infrastructure**: The Compose file, the Terraform module and the Helm chart name the released tag instead of `latest`

### Fixed

- **Invalid Object Ids**: An invalid id is rejected instead of being turned into a fabricated one
- **Request Bodies**: Only JSON bodies are accepted, with multipart scoped to the upload route
- **Generated Bootstrap Snippet**: The environment is optional, and the webpack profiles match the reference templates
- **Members Page Request Loop**: The project members page stops re-requesting in a loop
- **Repository Fetch Loop And 429s**: The repository fetch no longer loops into the rate limiter
- **View Switcher Alignment**: The microfrontends view switcher lines up with the header buttons

### Documentation

- [docs/REPOSITORY-IMPORT.md](docs/REPOSITORY-IMPORT.md) — importing repositories as microfrontends, with the API reference
- [docs/DEPENDENCIES.md](docs/DEPENDENCIES.md) — how the dependency scan and the peer dependency alignment work

## [2.2.0] - 2026-08-07

### Added

- **Reworked GitHub Connection**: The GitHub code repository connection was updated end to end

### Fixed

- **Self Invitations**: A user can no longer invite themselves to a project
- **Team Mates And i18n**: Missing translations and the team mates screen of the project
- **Login**: A login failure on the embedded provider

---

## [2.1.0] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- **All-in-One Docker Image**: `Dockerfile.all-in-one` builds a single container with the orchestrator, MongoDB (single node replica set, so transactions work), Redis and Nginx. `docker run -p 8080:80 -v mfe-data:/data lory1990/mfe-orchestrator:all-in-one` is a complete installation: no sidecar containers, all the state under `/data`, databases bound to the loopback and a JWT secret generated on first start. Supervisor keeps the four processes alive and takes the container down when one of them cannot start
- **Anonymous Telemetry**: Self-hosted installations send one anonymous ping per day with aggregate counters only (`installationId`, `version`, `nodeVersion`, `projects`, `microfrontends`, `environments`, `users`, `deploymentsLastWeek`). Enabled by default, off with `TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true` or `DO_NOT_TRACK=1`, never sent when `NODE_ENV` is not `prod`. The full payload is disclosed in the startup log, inspectable via `GET /api/telemetry/status` and documented field by field in [docs/TELEMETRY.md](docs/TELEMETRY.md)
- **Helm Chart**: `helm/mfe-orchestrator` installs the orchestrator on Kubernetes, with every environment variable exposed through `values.yaml`, ingress, persistence, probes, autoscaling and secrets kept outside the values file
- **Design System Package**: `@mfe-orchestrator/design-system` is consumed from GitHub Packages
- **New Project Wizard**: Restored and reused on the first run, sharing the storage form and the environment setup with the rest of the console
- **Redesigned Dashboard And Project Picker**: The microfrontends dashboard was redesigned, and the post-login picker shows projects as large tiles while making it clear that the switcher also creates them
- **Drag And Drop Environments**: Environments are reordered by dragging them
- **Clone Urls**: Microfrontends carry their HTTPS and SSH clone urls, offered through a clone popover
- **Apache-2.0 License**: The project is licensed under Apache-2.0

### Changed

- **Transactional Emails**: Aligned with the design system
- **Node 24**: Both the build and the GitHub Actions runners moved to Node 24

### Fixed

- **Telemetry**: The ping always carries a valid installation id and reaches the dedicated telemetry service
- **Translation Cache**: The browser cache of the translation files is busted on release, and the environments screens no longer miss strings
- **Project Users Cache**: Refreshed after sending an invite
- **Docker pnpm Version**: Pinned to the version declared in the workspace `packageManager`

### Documentation

- README rewritten as a landing page
